Automation:

Linear Script - sequence of instructions 
                followed explicitely by the computer

Conditional Branching - 


if [[ ! -e $file_name'.'$file_extension ]] (BOOLEAN EXPRESSION)
then
    touch $file_name'.'$file_extension
    pwd
    ls -l *.$file_extension
else
    echo File already exits!
fi 

add all the boolean goodness
