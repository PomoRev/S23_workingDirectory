BASH Shell Variables

BASH variables are simple symbolic replacement values (strings).

echo $name          only returns the first name because it does not retain the 
                    quotation marks
echo ${name}   or echo "$name"   will retain the space and hence print the whole
                    name.


Variables also have local scope within a script, and this is true of functions which 
can have local variables (which it uses by preference) and access to the calling 
context's variables. Global variables are those available to the BASH instance and 
can be seen with the env command. 

scope

we need to be specific to create a local (for a function) variable. By default
variables are hoisted to their script context. But the script runs in a shell 
that goes away after the script is run. If you want to preserve a value you need to export
that value to the calling environment.

FUNCTIONS

groups repeated operations. functions should do one thing. They can take arguments the same 
way as a script ( $1..9 etc. ), so if you need arguments from the calling environment you
must send them to the funtion in the function call (which looks like any other CLI program in BASH)


CONDITIONAL BRANCHING

The if Statement

if [expression]; then

    echo expression is true

elif [expression]; then

    echo other expression is true, but not first one

else

    echo neither were true

fi

The if..elif..else statement is fairly universal in modern languages today. 

The Switch or case Statement

The case statement is used to do simple pattern matching. It uses the following
rules:

-	Start with case ends with esac
-	Performs simple pattern matching (strings and characters)
-	Multiple patterns use an or (|) operator
-	Patterns with spaces must be quoted
-	Patterns can have special characters (GLOB) although it does 
    not use RegEx, just BLOG pattern matching.
-	Every pattern set ends with a closing parenthesis ) character
-	The * GLOB pattern is used to catch all other cases, 
    like an else or a default case
-	The pattern and the statements that belong to that pattern being 
    matched are called a clause
-	Every clause must end with a double semi-colon ;;
-	Only the first match for a clause will be executed.
-	Once a pattern is matched once the program flow continues 
    past the case statement. 

case [value] in 

    [pattern(s)])

        statements....
        ;;

    *)  #default pattern, think about how GLOB works

        statements....
        ;;

esac 


LOOPING

In terms of looping if you know how many times you are going to loop 
before you start the loop then you use a for loop (of some variety),
otherwise you use a traditional indefinite loop aka a while loop.


The C style for loop

for (( i=0; i<4; i++ ))
do
    echo " loop $i"
done 


Data iteration for loop

for line in $(ls)
do
    echo ":: $line"
done

Range iteration for loop

for i in {a..g}
do
    touch "file_$i.txt"
done

Traditional While loop

ls | while read line
do
    echo "---> $line"
done

Although a better use case for a while loop is around a control bock for 
a menu or block where we cannot calculate the number of iterations before 
we run the loop.


EXPANSION

The notion of expansion is that that an expression or command is evaluated and 
the results are returned as the "expanded" value. 

$variable_name or ${variable_name} both expand the variable to what value 
it currently holds

$( command ) runs the command in a subshell and expands into the returned
results, these commands can also have their own output

$(( mathematical_expression )) this will perform the math and expand into the 
result of the mathematical expression.



BASH SPECIAL CHARACTERS 

Here is a handy reference:

␢           Whitespace character is used to delimit 
            words and parameters. 
$           Expansion
'content'   Single Quotes are used to preserve the literal 
            value of the content, variables and GLOB characters 
            will not be expanded.
"content"   Double Quotes are used to protect the words inside 
            from splitting but does not restrict expansion 
            using the $ symbol.
\           Escape (backslash) prevents the next character from 
            being interpreted as a special character, works outside 
            of quotes or inside double quotes, but not inside single 
            quotes where it is ignored.
#           Comment
=           Assignment where whitespace is not allowed on either 
            side of the assignment character.
[[ expression ]]    Test used to evaluate an expression and 
                    return a Boolean value
!           Negate will reverse a test result or the exit status 
            of a function or command (Boolean NOT)
>, >>, <    Redirection:
    <       Redirects the stdio output to the previous command
    <<      Redirects a document to the previous command
    <<<     Redirects a string to the previous command
|           Pipe which sends the output from one command to another.
;           End command is used to separate commands on a single line.
{ }         Inline operator causes the commands inside to be 
            treated as if they were a single command and can be used 
            to create anonymous functions or preserve whitespace in 
            expansion. This is also used for brace expansion like in 
            our fancy for…in loop. 
( )         Subshell group which will execute commands in a new 
            process (subshell) so that we do not need to worry about 
            any variables that may be changed. Think of it like calling 
            a function with its own temporary local environment.
(( ))       Arithmetic expression when used without a $ character you can 
            actually do assignments inside: (( foo = 8 + 9 ))
&           Run in background can be added to the end of a command so 
            that the shell script will not wait for it to complete 
            before beginning the next command. 


READ COMMAND 

The read command will read input from the stdin stream and puts it in a
variable or set of variables. The read command has a default named location 
($REPLY) that can be used to access the read data. Read is a great way to 
collect user input in a script or simply to capture data from a command 
or a file. If we want to read in all the values in an array we can use the
-a option, if we want to output a prompt the -p option is helpful. 

read -p "What is your name?: " username

or 

read var1 var2 <<< "Hello World"


STRING SLICING AND REPRESENTATION THROUGH EXPANSION 

${name}         expands as the value of the variable name
                it is a literal string replacement

Using the format ${variablename:position:length} we can slice up
the expanded string into substrings.

${name:0:1} or ${name::1}   expands to the first character of the 
                string value in name
${name::4}      expands to the first four characters of the value
                in name
${name: -1:1}   expands to the last character of the value in name
${name: -2:2}   expands to the last two characters of the value in name

We can use similar syntax to do simple character replacement.

${name/F/f}     expands to the value in name but all capital F characters
                are expanded as lowercase fs.

We can also use default values for when variables may not be set yet. And
finally we can change the case of the expanded value:

${name,,}       expands to the value of name but all alphabetic characters
                are converted to lower case (just one , will make only the
                first character small)
${name^^}       same as above but will capitalize all the alphabetic
                characters and there is also a single ^ version for just 
                the first letter of the value name.
